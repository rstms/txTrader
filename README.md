txTrader - Twisted Trading API Controller 
=========================================

Overview - what is this thing, and what does it do?
---------------------------------------------------
- Cross-Platform securities trading API management engine   
- Encapsulates the interaction with the broker's API 
- Provides a trader's eye view of the interaction with the trading software API.    
- Manages connection and communication details of the order management / trade execution transaction.   
- Frees trading software from timing and architectural constraints imposed by the order execution API.


Description
-----------
This system aims to present an interface to trading software comprised of objects, procedures, and events that directly represent trading activities.  Common API designs expose implementation details such as message packet parsing, message and field IDs, blocking, threading, and event handling mechanisms.  This design seems to represent the point of view of the trading software implementor. Another goal of txTrader is to decouple the application software from strict timing and sequencing requirements.  

This software implemements interfaces to the API for CQG's CQGNet application and Interactive Brokers' Trader Workstation.  The servers provide access to realtime market data, historical barcharts, order management, execution reports, and position data.

The gateway is built on the twisted python server architecture.  Each instance implements a TCP/IP ASCII line-delimited protocol as well as JSON over HTTP interface.  Both services are password protected using basic authentication and a password handshake.

Common interface code is used to provide identical access to CQG and TWS.  Note that the contents of the returned objects may differ.  Many fieldnames are common to the two environments.

Status change events are available on the TCP/IP streaming service.  The data are JSON-formatted objects.


Dependencies
------------

TxTrader's server daemons depend on external libraries for each configured API:

 - Interactive Brokers
   - IbPy python wrappers for IB's java/C++ API
   - bootstrap script uses pinned fork at https://github.com/rstms/IbPy
   - https://interactivebrokers.github.io


 - CQG
   - server runs under Windows
   - uses win32com to access CQG's COM API
   - http://partners.cqg.com/api-resources


 - RealTick
   - uses RTGW Txtrader GateWay running under Linux
   - consult your RealTick customer service agent for API details
    

Installation
------------
```
pip install txtrader
```

Run as a local daemon process
-----------------------------
```
txtraderd &
```

Run in a Docker container
---------------------------
```
docker start rstms/txtrader:latest
```

Configuration
-------------
At startup of a local process or as a docker container, environment variables are read to set configuration. Each variable has a
default value that will be used if it is not present.

To read configuration from a file, use a tool like envdir or cfgdir or a bash script may be used to set the desired variables.

Security
--------
This sofware is designed to be used on private internal infrastructure.   It is *NOT* intended to be exposed to the public Internet. 
TxTrader currently doesn't implement HTTPS and the password mechanism is rudimentary.  It is expected that access be controlled
at the system level.

Security mechanisms used in existing deployments include:
 - virtual machine private networking
 - local private network addressing
 - VPN
 - docker container netorking
 - ssh port forwarding
 - firewall rules
